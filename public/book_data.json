He was a genius, having designed and\npatented a key component in Wi-Fi routers in his 20s. He had started and sold several\ncompanies. He was wildly successful.\nHe also had a relationship with money I\u2019d describe as a mix of insecurity and childish\nstupidity.\nHe carried a stack of hundred dollar bills several inches thick. He showed it to everyone\nwho wanted to see it and many who didn\u2019t. He bragged openly and loudly about his wealth,\noften while drunk and always apropos of nothing.\nOne day he handed one of my colleagues several thousand dollars of cash and said, \u201cGo to\nthe jewelry store down the street and get me a few $1,000 gold coins.\u201d\nAn hour later, gold coins in hand, the tech executive and his buddies gathered around by a\ndock overlooking the Paci\ufb01c Ocean. They then proceeded to throw the coins into the sea,\nskipping them like rocks, cackling as they argued whose went furthest. Just for fun.\nDays later he shattered a lamp in the hotel\u2019s restaurant. A manager told him it was a $500\nlamp and he\u2019d have to replace it.\n\u201cYou want \ufb01ve hundred dollars?\u201d the executive asked incredulously, while pulling a brick of\ncash from his pocket and handing it to the manager. \u201cHere\u2019s \ufb01ve thousand dollars. Now get\nout of my face. And don\u2019t ever insult me like that again.\u201d\nYou may wonder how long this behavior could last, and the answer was \u201cnot long.\u201d I learned\nyears later that he went broke.\nThe premise of this book is that doing well with money has a little to do with how smart you\nare and a lot to do with how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart\npeople."

                "content": "A genius who loses control of their emotions can be a \ufb01nancial disaster. The opposite is also\ntrue. Ordinary folks with no \ufb01nancial education can be wealthy if they have a handful of\nbehavioral skills that have nothing to do with formal measures of intelligence.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMy favorite Wikipedia entry begins: \u201cRonald James Read was an American philanthropist,\ninvestor, janitor, and gas station attendant.\u201d\nRonald Read was born in rural Vermont. He was the \ufb01rst person in his family to graduate\nhigh school, made all the more impressive by the fact that he hitchhiked to campus each\nday.\nFor those who knew Ronald Read, there wasn\u2019t much else worth mentioning. His life was\nabout as low key as they come.\nRead \ufb01xed cars at a gas station for 25 years and swept \ufb02oors at JCPenney for 17 years. He\nbought a two-bedroom house for $12,000 at age 38 and lived there for the rest of his life.\nHe was widowed at age 50 and never remarried. A friend recalled that his main hobby was\nchopping \ufb01rewood.\nRead died in 2014, age 92. Which is when the humble rural janitor made international\nheadlines.\n2,813,503 Americans died in 2014. Fewer than 4,000 of them had a net worth of over $8\nmillion when they passed away. Ronald Read was one of them.\nIn his will the former janitor left $2 million to his stepkids and more than $6 million to his\nlocal hospital and library.\nThose who knew Read were ba\ufb04ed. Where did he get all that money?\nIt turned out there was no secret. There was no lottery win and no inheritance. Read saved\nwhat little he could and invested it in blue chip stocks. Then he waited, for decades on end,\nas tiny savings compounded into more than $8 million.\nThat\u2019s it. From janitor to philanthropist.\nA few months before Ronald Read died, another man named Richard was in the news.\nRichard Fuscone was everything Ronald Read was not. A Harvard-educated Merrill Lynch\nexecutive with an MBA, Fuscone had such a successful career in \ufb01nance that he retired in\nhis 40s to become a philanthropist. Former Merrill CEO David Komansky praised Fuscone\u2019s\n\u201cbusiness savvy, leadership skills, sound judgment and personal integrity.\u201d\u00b9 Crain\u2019s\nbusiness magazine once included him in a \u201c40 under 40\u201d list of successful businesspeople.\u00b2\nBut then\u2014like the gold-coin-skipping tech executive\u2014everything fell apart.\nIn the mid-2000s Fuscone borrowed heavily to expand an 18,000-square foot home in\nGreenwich, Connecticut that had 11 bathrooms, two elevators, two pools, seven garages,\nand cost more than $90,000 a month to maintain.\nThen the 2008 \ufb01nancial crisis hit.\nThe crisis hurt virtually everyone\u2019s \ufb01nances. It apparently turned Fuscone\u2019s into dust. High\ndebt and illiquid assets left him bankrupt. \u201cI currently have no income,\u201d he allegedly told a"

That\u2019s all it took to eclipse the\nmassive education and experience gap between the two.\nThe lesson here is not to be more like Ronald and less like Richard\u2014though that\u2019s not bad\nadvice.\nThe fascinating thing about these stories is how unique they are to \ufb01nance.\nIn what other industry does someone with no college degree, no training, no background,\nno formal experience, and no connections massively outperform someone with the best\neducation, the best training, and the best connections?\nI struggle to think of any.\nIt is impossible to think of a story about Ronald Read performing a heart transplant better\nthan a Harvard-trained surgeon. Or designing a skyscraper superior to the best-trained\narchitects. There will never be a story of a janitor outperforming the world\u2019s top nuclear\nengineers.\nBut these stories do happen in investing.\nThe fact that Ronald Read can coexist with Richard Fuscone has two explanations. One,\n\ufb01nancial outcomes are driven by luck, independent of intelligence and e\ufb00ort. That\u2019s true to\nsome extent, and this book will discuss it in further detail. Or, two (and I think more\ncommon), that \ufb01nancial success is not a hard science. It\u2019s a soft skill, where how you\nbehave is more important than what you know.\nI call this soft skill the psychology of money. The aim of this book is to use short stories to\nconvince you that soft skills are more important than the technical side of money. I\u2019ll do this\nin a way that will help everyone\u2014from Read to Fuscone and everyone in between\u2014make\nbetter \ufb01nancial decisions.\nThese soft skills are, I\u2019ve come to realize, greatly underappreciated.\nFinance is overwhelmingly taught as a math-based \ufb01eld, where you put data into a formula\nand the formula tells you what to do, and it\u2019s assumed that you\u2019ll just go do it.\nThis is true in personal \ufb01nance, where you\u2019re told to have a six-month emergency fund and\nsave 10% of your salary.\nIt\u2019s true in investing, where we know the exact historical correlations between interest rates\nand valuations.\nAnd it\u2019s true in corporate \ufb01nance, where CFOs can measure the precise cost of capital."

The truth is, our actions dictate only a fraction of our outcomes; the world is far too complex for complete control. Noteworthy is economist Robert Shiller's reflection on the enigmatic influence of luck in investment success, a sentiment echoed in societal reluctance to fully attribute success to chance. Nonetheless, research like Bhashkar Mazumder's demonstrates income likeness in siblings, hinting at systemic factors beyond merit.",

An individual's downfall is often attributed to poor choices, yet in truth, systemic complexity deeply muddies the waters of cause and effect. Cultural narratives frequently celebrate successful individuals without acknowledging the role of risk and luck, leading to misconceptions about repeatable success strategies. This highlights a cognitive bias in evaluating achievements\u2014while we aim to replicate what seemingly works, without acknowledging luck, these strategies may not guarantee similar outcomes.",

Heller calmly replied, 'Yes, but I have something he will never have\u2026 enough.' This simplicity of 'enough' highlighted a striking truth: in society, especially among the wealthy, there's often no limit to what constitutes enough.",

Gupta, from a humble beginning in Kolkata, rose to become the prestigious CEO of McKinsey, amassing wealth and influence. Yet he yearned for more\u2014billionaire status. This drove him to insider trading, ultimately leading to his fall from grace. Similarly, Madoff, before his Ponzi scheme, was a legitimate and successful market maker. Nevertheless, the insatiable desire for more led him to fraud.",

Warren Buffett once remarked on such irrational behavior: 'To make money they didn't have and didn't need, they risked what they did have and did need.' This highlights how the inability to stop the moving goalpost of financial success leads to ruin. Social comparison only exacerbates this, as illustrated by the disparity in earnings across different fields.",

Knowing 'enough' isn't conservatism but recognizing the destructive potential of the endless pursuit of more, akin to knowing one's limit with food before it ends in regret. There are invaluable facets like reputation that should never be risked regardless of the gain, as learned by Gupta post-prison, 'Don't get too attached to anything\u2014your reputation, your accomplishments or any of it.'",
