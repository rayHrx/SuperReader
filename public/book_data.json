He was a genius, having designed and\npatented a key component in Wi-Fi routers in his 20s. He had started and sold several\ncompanies. He was wildly successful.\nHe also had a relationship with money I\u2019d describe as a mix of insecurity and childish\nstupidity.\nHe carried a stack of hundred dollar bills several inches thick. He showed it to everyone\nwho wanted to see it and many who didn\u2019t. He bragged openly and loudly about his wealth,\noften while drunk and always apropos of nothing.\nOne day he handed one of my colleagues several thousand dollars of cash and said, \u201cGo to\nthe jewelry store down the street and get me a few $1,000 gold coins.\u201d\nAn hour later, gold coins in hand, the tech executive and his buddies gathered around by a\ndock overlooking the Paci\ufb01c Ocean. They then proceeded to throw the coins into the sea,\nskipping them like rocks, cackling as they argued whose went furthest. Just for fun.\nDays later he shattered a lamp in the hotel\u2019s restaurant. A manager told him it was a $500\nlamp and he\u2019d have to replace it.\n\u201cYou want \ufb01ve hundred dollars?\u201d the executive asked incredulously, while pulling a brick of\ncash from his pocket and handing it to the manager. \u201cHere\u2019s \ufb01ve thousand dollars.

And don\u2019t ever insult me like that again.\u201d\nYou may wonder how long this behavior could last, and the answer was \u201cnot long.\u201d I learned\nyears later that he went broke.\nThe premise of this book is that doing well with money has a little to do with how smart you\nare and a lot to do with how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart\npeople.\n"

                "content": "A genius who loses control of their emotions can be a \ufb01nancial disaster. The opposite is also\ntrue. Ordinary folks with no \ufb01nancial education can be wealthy if they have a handful of\nbehavioral skills that have nothing to do with formal measures of intelligence.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMy favorite Wikipedia entry begins: \u201cRonald James Read was an American philanthropist,\ninvestor, janitor, and gas station attendant.\u201d\nRonald Read was born in rural Vermont. He was the \ufb01rst person in his family to graduate\nhigh school, made all the more impressive by the fact that he hitchhiked to campus each\nday.\nFor those who knew Ronald Read, there wasn\u2019t much else worth mentioning. His life was\nabout as low key as they come.\nRead \ufb01xed cars at a gas station for 25 years and swept \ufb02oors at JCPenney for 17 years. He\nbought a two-bedroom house for $12,000 at age 38 and lived there for the rest of his life.\nHe was widowed at age 50 and never remarried. A friend recalled that his main hobby was\nchopping \ufb01rewood.\nRead died in 2014, age 92. Which is when the humble rural janitor made international\nheadlines.\n2,813,503 Americans died in 2014. Fewer than 4,000 of them had a net worth of over $8\nmillion when they passed away. Ronald Read was one of them.\nIn his will the former janitor left $2 million to his stepkids and more than $6 million to his\nlocal hospital and library.\nThose who knew Read were ba\ufb04ed. Where did he get all that money?\nIt turned out there was no secret. There was no lottery win and no inheritance. Read saved\nwhat little he could and invested it in blue chip stocks. Then he waited, for decades on end,\nas tiny savings compounded into more than $8 million.\nThat\u2019s it. From janitor to philanthropist.\nA few months before Ronald Read died, another man named Richard was in the news.\nRichard Fuscone was everything Ronald Read was not. A Harvard-educated Merrill Lynch\nexecutive with an MBA, Fuscone had such a successful career in \ufb01nance that he retired in\nhis 40s to become a philanthropist. Former Merrill CEO David Komansky praised Fuscone\u2019s\n\u201cbusiness savvy, leadership skills, sound judgment and personal integrity.\u201d\u00b9 Crain\u2019s\nbusiness magazine once included him in a \u201c40 under 40\u201d list of successful businesspeople.\u00b2\nBut then\u2014like the gold-coin-skipping tech executive\u2014everything fell apart.\nIn the mid-2000s Fuscone borrowed heavily to expand an 18,000-square foot home in\nGreenwich, Connecticut that had 11 bathrooms, two elevators, two pools, seven garages,\nand cost more than $90,000 a month to maintain.\nThen the 2008 \ufb01nancial crisis hit.\nThe crisis hurt virtually everyone\u2019s \ufb01nances. It apparently turned Fuscone\u2019s into dust. High\ndebt and illiquid assets left him bankrupt. \u201cI currently have no income,\u201d he allegedly told a\n"

That\u2019s all it took to eclipse the\nmassive education and experience gap between the two.\nThe lesson here is not to be more like Ronald and less like Richard\u2014though that\u2019s not bad\nadvice.\nThe fascinating thing about these stories is how unique they are to \ufb01nance.\nIn what other industry does someone with no college degree, no training, no background,\nno formal experience, and no connections massively outperform someone with the best\neducation, the best training, and the best connections?\nI struggle to think of any.\nIt is impossible to think of a story about Ronald Read performing a heart transplant better\nthan a Harvard-trained surgeon. Or designing a skyscraper superior to the best-trained\narchitects. There will never be a story of a janitor outperforming the world\u2019s top nuclear\nengineers.\nBut these stories do happen in investing.\nThe fact that Ronald Read can coexist with Richard Fuscone has two explanations. One,\n\ufb01nancial outcomes are driven by luck, independent of intelligence and e\ufb00ort. That\u2019s true to\nsome extent, and this book will discuss it in further detail. Or, two (and I think more\ncommon), that \ufb01nancial success is not a hard science. It\u2019s a soft skill, where how you\nbehave is more important than what you know.\nI call this soft skill the psychology of money. The aim of this book is to use short stories to\nconvince you that soft skills are more important than the technical side of money. I\u2019ll do this\nin a way that will help everyone\u2014from Read to Fuscone and everyone in between\u2014make\nbetter \ufb01nancial decisions.\nThese soft skills are, I\u2019ve come to realize, greatly underappreciated.\nFinance is overwhelmingly taught as a math-based \ufb01eld, where you put data into a formula\nand the formula tells you what to do, and it\u2019s assumed that you\u2019ll just go do it.\nThis is true in personal \ufb01nance, where you\u2019re told to have a six-month emergency fund and\nsave 10% of your salary.\nIt\u2019s true in investing, where we know the exact historical correlations between interest rates\nand valuations.\nAnd it\u2019s true in corporate \ufb01nance, where CFOs can measure the precise cost of capital.\n"

It\u2019s that knowing what to do tells you\nnothing about what happens in your head when you try to do it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTwo topics impact everyone, whether you are interested in them or not: health and money.\nThe health care industry is a triumph of modern science, with rising life expectancy across\nthe world. Scienti\ufb01c discoveries have replaced doctors\u2019 old ideas about how the human\nbody works, and virtually everyone is healthier because of it.\nThe money industry\u2014investing, personal \ufb01nance, business planning\u2014is another story.\nFinance has scooped up the smartest minds coming from top universities over the last two\ndecades. Financial Engineering was the most popular major in Princeton\u2019s School of\nEngineering a decade ago. Is there any evidence it has made us better investors?\nI have seen none.\nThrough collective trial and error over the years we learned how to become better farmers,\nskilled plumbers, and advanced chemists. But has trial and error taught us to become\nbetter with our personal \ufb01nances? Are we less likely to bury ourselves in debt? More likely\nto save for a rainy day? Prepare for retirement? Have realistic views about what money\ndoes, and doesn\u2019t do, to our happiness?\nI\u2019ve seen no compelling evidence.\nMost of the reason why, I believe, is that we think about and are taught about money in\nways that are too much like physics (with rules and laws) and not enough like psychology\n(with emotions and nuance).\nAnd that, to me, is as fascinating as it is important.\nMoney is everywhere, it a\ufb00ects all of us, and confuses most of us. Everyone thinks about it a\nlittle di\ufb00erently. It o\ufb00ers lessons on things that apply to many areas of life, like risk,\ncon\ufb01dence, and happiness. Few topics o\ufb00er a more powerful magnifying glass that helps\nexplain why people behave the way they do than money. It is one of the greatest shows on\nEarth.\nMy own appreciation for the psychology of money is shaped by more than a decade of\nwriting on the topic. I began writing about \ufb01nance in early 2008. It was the dawn of a\n\ufb01nancial crisis and the worst recession in 80 years.\nTo write about what was happening, I wanted to \ufb01gure out what was happening. But the\n\ufb01rst thing I learned after the \ufb01nancial crisis was that no one could accurately explain what\nhappened, or why it happened, let alone what should be done about it. For every good\nexplanation there was an equally convincing rebuttal.\nEngineers can determine the cause of a bridge collapse because there\u2019s agreement that if a\ncertain amount of force is applied to a certain area, that area will break. Physics isn\u2019t\ncontroversial. It\u2019s guided by laws. Finance is di\ufb00erent. It\u2019s guided by people\u2019s behaviors.\nAnd how I behave might make sense to me but look crazy to you.\nThe more I studied and wrote about the \ufb01nancial crisis, the more I realized that you could\nunderstand it better through the lenses of psychology and history, not \ufb01nance.\n"

Where does the thin line between bold\nand reckless fall here? I don\u2019t know.

Ordinary folks with no \ufb01nancial education can be wealthy if they have a handful of\nbehavioral skills that have nothing to do with formal measures of intelligence.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMy favorite Wikipedia entry begins: \u201cRonald James Read was an American philanthropist,\ninvestor, janitor, and gas station attendant.\u201d\nRonald Read was born in rural Vermont. He was the \ufb01rst person in his family to graduate\nhigh school, made all the more impressive by the fact that he hitchhiked to campus each\nday.\nFor those who knew Ronald Read, there wasn\u2019t much else worth mentioning. His life was\nabout as low key as they come.\nRead \ufb01xed cars at a gas station for 25 years and swept \ufb02oors at JCPenney for 17 years. He\nbought a two-bedroom house for $12,000 at age 38 and lived there for the rest of his life.\nHe was widowed at age 50 and never remarried. A friend recalled that his main hobby was\nchopping \ufb01rewood.\nRead died in 2014, age 92. Which is when the humble rural janitor made international\nheadlines.\n2,813,503 Americans died in 2014. Fewer than 4,000 of them had a net worth of over $8\nmillion when they passed away. Ronald Read was one of them.\nIn his will the former janitor left $2 million to his stepkids and more than $6 million to his\nlocal hospital and library.\nThose who knew Read were ba\ufb04ed. Where did he get all that money?\nIt turned out there was no secret. There was no lottery win and no inheritance. Read saved\nwhat little he could and invested it in blue chip stocks. Then he waited, for decades on end,\nas tiny savings compounded into more than $8 million.\nThat\u2019s it. From janitor to philanthropist.\nA few months before Ronald Read died, another man named Richard was in the news.\nRichard Fuscone was everything Ronald Read was not. A Harvard-educated Merrill Lynch\nexecutive with an MBA, Fuscone had such a successful career in \ufb01nance that he retired in\nhis 40s to become a philanthropist. Former Merrill CEO David Komansky praised Fuscone\u2019s\n\u201cbusiness savvy, leadership skills, sound judgment and personal integrity.\u201d\u00b9 Crain\u2019s\nbusiness magazine once included him in a \u201c40 under 40\u201d list of successful businesspeople.\u00b2\nBut then\u2014like the gold-coin-skipping tech executive\u2014everything fell apart.\nIn the mid-2000s Fuscone borrowed heavily to expand an 18,000-square foot home in\nGreenwich, Connecticut that had 11 bathrooms, two elevators, two pools, seven garages,\nand cost more than $90,000 a month to maintain.\nThen the 2008 \ufb01nancial crisis hit.\nThe crisis hurt virtually everyone\u2019s \ufb01nances. It apparently turned Fuscone\u2019s into dust. High\ndebt and illiquid assets left him bankrupt. \u201cI currently have no income,\u201d he allegedly told a\nbankruptcy judge in 2008.\nFirst his Palm Beach house was foreclosed.\nIn 2014 it was the Greenwich mansion\u2019s turn.\nFive months before Ronald Read left his fortune to charity, Richard Fuscone\u2019s home\u2014where\nguests recalled the \u201cthrill of dining and dancing atop a see-through covering on the home\u2019s\nindoor swimming pool\u201d\u2014was sold in a foreclosure auction for 75% less than an insurance\ncompany \ufb01gured it was worth.\u00b3\nRonald Read was patient; Richard Fuscone was greedy. That\u2019s all it took to eclipse the\nmassive education and experience gap between the two.\nThe lesson here is not to be more like Ronald and less like Richard\u2014though that\u2019s not bad\nadvice.\nThe fascinating thing about these stories is how unique they are to \ufb01nance.\nIn what other industry does someone with no college degree, no training, no background,\nno formal experience, and no connections massively outperform someone with the best\neducation, the best training, and the best connections?\nI struggle to think of any.\nIt is impossible to think of a story about Ronald Read performing a heart transplant better\nthan a Harvard-trained surgeon. Or designing a skyscraper superior to the best-trained\narchitects. There will never be a story of a janitor outperforming the world\u2019s top nuclear\nengineers.\nBut these stories do happen in investing.\nThe fact that Ronald Read can coexist with Richard Fuscone has two explanations. One,\n\ufb01nancial outcomes are driven by luck, independent of intelligence and e\ufb00ort. That\u2019s true to\nsome extent, and this book will discuss it in further detail. Or, two (and I think more\ncommon), that \ufb01nancial success is not a hard science. It\u2019s a soft skill, where how you\nbehave is more important than what you know.\nI call this soft skill the psychology of money. The aim of this book is to use short stories to\nconvince you that soft skills are more important than the technical side of money. I\u2019ll do this\nin a way that will help everyone\u2014from Read to Fuscone and everyone in between\u2014make\nbetter \ufb01nancial decisions.\nThese soft skills are, I\u2019ve come to realize, greatly underappreciated.\nFinance is overwhelmingly taught as a math-based \ufb01eld, where you put data into a formula\nand the formula tells you what to do, and it\u2019s assumed that you\u2019ll just go do it.\nThis is true in personal \ufb01nance, where you\u2019re told to have a six-month emergency fund and\nsave 10% of your salary.\nIt\u2019s true in investing, where we know the exact historical correlations between interest rates\nand valuations.\nAnd it\u2019s true in corporate \ufb01nance, where CFOs can measure the precise cost of capital.\nIt\u2019s not that any of these things are bad or wrong. It\u2019s that knowing what to do tells you\nnothing about what happens in your head when you try to do it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTwo topics impact everyone, whether you are interested in them or not: health and money.\nThe health care industry is a triumph of modern science, with rising life expectancy across\nthe world. Scienti\ufb01c discoveries have replaced doctors\u2019 old ideas about how the human\nbody works, and virtually everyone is healthier because of it.\nThe money industry\u2014investing, personal \ufb01nance, business planning\u2014is another story.\nFinance has scooped up the smartest minds coming from top universities over the last two\ndecades. Financial Engineering was the most popular major in Princeton\u2019s School of\nEngineering a decade ago. Is there any evidence it has made us better investors?\nI have seen none.\nThrough collective trial and error over the years we learned how to become better farmers,\nskilled plumbers, and advanced chemists. But has trial and error taught us to become\nbetter with our personal \ufb01nances? Are we less likely to bury ourselves in debt? More likely\nto save for a rainy day? Prepare for retirement? Have realistic views about what money\ndoes, and doesn\u2019t do, to our happiness?\nI\u2019ve seen no compelling evidence.\nMost of the reason why, I believe, is that we think about and are taught about money in\nways that are too much like physics (with rules and laws) and not enough like psychology\n(with emotions and nuance).\nAnd that, to me, is as fascinating as it is important.\nMoney is everywhere, it a\ufb00ects all of us, and confuses most of us. Everyone thinks about it a\nlittle di\ufb00erently. It o\ufb00ers lessons on things that apply to many areas of life, like risk,\ncon\ufb01dence, and happiness. Few topics o\ufb00er a more powerful magnifying glass that helps\nexplain why people behave the way they do than money. It is one of the greatest shows on\nEarth.\nMy own appreciation for the psychology of money is shaped by more than a decade of\nwriting on the topic. I began writing about \ufb01nance in early 2008. It was the dawn of a\n\ufb01nancial crisis and the worst recession in 80 years.\nTo write about what was happening, I wanted to \ufb01gure out what was happening. But the\n\ufb01rst thing I learned after the \ufb01nancial crisis was that no one could accurately explain what\nhappened, or why it happened, let alone what should be done about it. For every good\nexplanation there was an equally convincing rebuttal.\nEngineers can determine the cause of a bridge collapse because there\u2019s agreement that if a\ncertain amount of force is applied to a certain area, that area will break. Physics isn\u2019t\ncontroversial. It\u2019s guided by laws. Finance is di\ufb00erent. It\u2019s guided by people\u2019s behaviors.\nAnd how I behave might make sense to me but look crazy to you.\nThe more I studied and wrote about the \ufb01nancial crisis, the more I realized that you could\nunderstand it better through the lenses of psychology and history, not \ufb01nance.\nTo grasp why people bury themselves in debt you don\u2019t need to study interest rates; you\nneed to study the history of greed, insecurity, and optimism. To get why investors sell out at\nthe bottom of a bear market you don\u2019t need to study the math of expected future returns;\nyou need to think about the agony of looking at your family and wondering if your\ninvestments are imperiling their future.\nI love Voltaire\u2019s observation that \u201cHistory never repeats itself; man always does.\u201d It applies\nso well to how we behave with money.\nIn 2018, I wrote a report outlining 20 of the most important \ufb02aws, biases, and causes of\nbad behavior I\u2019ve seen a\ufb00ect people when dealing with money. It was called The Psychology\nof Money, and over one million people have read it. This book is a deeper dive into the\ntopic. Some short passages from the report appear unaltered in this book.\nWhat you\u2019re holding is 20 chapters, each describing what I consider to be the most\nimportant and often counterintuitive features of the psychology of money. The chapters\nrevolve around a common theme, but exist on their own and can be read independently.\nIt\u2019s not a long book. You\u2019re welcome. Most readers don\u2019t \ufb01nish the books they begin\nbecause most single topics don\u2019t require 300 pages of explanation. I\u2019d rather make 20 short\npoints you \ufb01nish than one long one you give up on.\nOn we go.\n"

                "content": "Let me tell you about a problem. It might make you feel better\nabout what you do with your money, and less judgmental\nabout what other people do with theirs.\nPeople do some crazy things with money. But no one is crazy.\nHere\u2019s the thing: People from di\ufb00erent generations, raised by\ndi\ufb00erent parents who earned di\ufb00erent incomes and held\ndi\ufb00erent values, in di\ufb00erent parts of the world, born into\ndi\ufb00erent economies, experiencing di\ufb00erent job markets with\ndi\ufb00erent incentives and di\ufb00erent degrees of luck, learn very\ndi\ufb00erent lessons.\nEveryone has their own unique experience with how the world\nworks. And what you\u2019ve experienced is more compelling than\nwhat you learn second-hand. So all of us\u2014you, me, everyone\u2014\ngo through life anchored to a set of views about how money\nworks that vary wildly from person to person. What seems\ncrazy to you might make sense to me.\nThe person who grew up in poverty thinks about risk and\nreward in ways the child of a wealthy banker cannot fathom if\nhe tried.\nThe person who grew up when in\ufb02ation was high experienced\nsomething the person who grew up with stable prices never\nhad to.\nThe stock broker who lost everything during the Great\nDepression experienced something the tech worker basking in\nthe glory of the late 1990s can\u2019t imagine.\nThe Australian who hasn\u2019t seen a recession in 30 years has\nexperienced something no American ever has.\nOn and on. The list of experiences is endless.\nYou know stu\ufb00 about money that I don\u2019t, and vice versa. You go\nthrough life with di\ufb00erent beliefs, goals, and forecasts, than I\ndo. That\u2019s not because one of us is smarter than the other, or\nhas better information. It\u2019s because we\u2019ve had di\ufb00erent lives\nshaped by di\ufb00erent and equally persuasive experiences.\nYour personal experiences with money make up maybe\n0.00000001% of what\u2019s happened in the world, but maybe\n80% of how you think the world works. So equally smart\npeople can disagree about how and why recessions happen,\nhow you should invest your money, what you should prioritize,\nhow much risk you should take, and so on.\nIn his book on 1930s America, Frederick Lewis Allen wrote that\nthe Great Depression \u201cmarked millions of Americans\u2014inwardly\n\u2014for the rest of their lives.\u201d But there was a range of\nexperiences. Twenty-\ufb01ve years later, as he was running for\npresident, John F. Kennedy was asked by a reporter what he\nremembered from the Depression. He remarked:\n\u00a0\nI have no \ufb01rst-hand knowledge of the Depression. My family\nhad one of the great fortunes of the world and it was worth\nmore than ever then. We had bigger houses, more servants, we\ntraveled more. About the only thing that I saw directly was\nwhen my father hired some extra gardeners just to give them a\njob so they could eat. I really did not learn about the\nDepression until I read about it at Harvard.\n\u00a0\nThis was a major point in the 1960 election. How, people\nthought, could someone with no understanding of the biggest\neconomic story of the last generation be put in charge of the\neconomy? It was, in many ways, overcome only by JFK\u2019s\nexperience in World War II. That was the other most\nwidespread emotional experience of the previous generation,\nand something his primary opponent, Hubert Humphrey, didn\u2019t\nhave.\nThe challenge for us is that no amount of studying or open-\nmindedness can genuinely recreate the power of fear and\nuncertainty.\nI can read about what it was like to lose everything during the\nGreat Depression. But I don\u2019t have the emotional scars of those\nwho actually experienced it. And the person who lived through\nit can\u2019t fathom why someone like me could come across as\ncomplacent about things like owning stocks. We see the world\nthrough a di\ufb00erent lens.\nSpreadsheets can model the historic frequency of big stock\nmarket declines. But they can\u2019t model the feeling of coming\nhome, looking at your kids, and wondering if you\u2019ve made a\nmistake that will impact their lives. Studying history makes you\nfeel like you understand something. But until you\u2019ve lived\nthrough it and personally felt its consequences, you may not\nunderstand it enough to change your behavior.\nWe all think we know how the world works. But we\u2019ve all only\nexperienced a tiny sliver of it.\nAs investor Michael Batnick says, \u201csome lessons have to be\nexperienced before they can be understood.\u201d We are all\nvictims, in di\ufb00erent ways, to that truth.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn 2006 economists Ulrike Malmendier and Stefan Nagel from\nthe National Bureau of Economic Research dug through 50\nyears of the Survey of Consumer Finances\u2014a detailed look at\nwhat Americans do with their money.\u2074\nIn theory people should make investment decisions based on\ntheir goals and the characteristics of the investment options\navailable to them at the time.\nBut that\u2019s not what people do.\nThe economists found that people\u2019s lifetime investment\ndecisions are heavily anchored to the experiences those\ninvestors had in their own generation\u2014especially experiences\nearly in their adult life.\nIf you grew up when in\ufb02ation was high, you invested less of\nyour money in bonds later in life compared to those who grew\nup when in\ufb02ation was low. If you happened to grow up when\nthe stock market was strong, you invested more of your money\nin stocks later in life compared to those who grew up when\nstocks were weak.\nThe economists wrote: \u201cOur \ufb01ndings suggest that individual\ninvestors\u2019 willingness to bear risk depends on personal history.\u201d\nNot intelligence, or education, or sophistication. Just the dumb\nluck of when and where you were born.\nThe Financial Times interviewed Bill Gross, the famed bond\nmanager, in 2019. \u201cGross admits that he would probably not\nbe where he is today if he had been born a decade earlier or\nlater,\u201d the piece said. Gross\u2019s career coincided almost perfectly\nwith a generational collapse in interest rates that gave bond\nprices a tailwind. That kind of thing doesn\u2019t just a\ufb00ect the\nopportunities you come across; it a\ufb00ects what you think about\nthose opportunities when they\u2019re presented to you. To Gross,\nbonds were wealth-generating machines. To his father\u2019s\ngeneration, who grew up with and endured higher in\ufb02ation,\nthey might be seen as wealth incinerators.\nThe di\ufb00erences in how people have experienced money are not\nsmall, even among those you might think are pretty similar.\nTake stocks. If you were born in 1970, the S&P 500 increased\nalmost 10-fold, adjusted for in\ufb02ation, during your teens and\n20s. That\u2019s an amazing return. If you were born in 1950, the\nmarket went literally nowhere in your teens and 20s adjusted\nfor in\ufb02ation. Two groups of people, separated by chance of\ntheir birth year, go through life with a completely di\ufb00erent\nview on how the stock market works:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOr in\ufb02ation. If you were born in 1960s America, in\ufb02ation during\nyour teens and 20s\u2014your young, impressionable years when\nyou\u2019re developing a base of knowledge about how the\neconomy works\u2014sent prices up more than threefold. That\u2019s a\nlot. You remember gas lines and getting paychecks that\nstretched noticeably less far than the ones before them. But if\nyou were born in 1990, in\ufb02ation has been so low for your whole\nlife that it\u2019s probably never crossed your mind.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAmerica\u2019s nationwide unemployment in November 2009 was\naround 10%. But the unemployment rate for African American\nmales age 16 to 19 without a high school diploma was 49%.\nFor Caucasian females over age 45 with a college degree, it\nwas 4%.\nLocal stock markets in Germany and Japan were wiped out\nduring World War II. Entire regions were bombed out. At the\nend of the war German farms only produced enough food to\nprovide the country\u2019s citizens with 1,000 calories a day.\nCompare that to the U.S., where the stock market more than\ndoubled from 1941 through the end of 1945, and the economy\nwas the strongest it had been in almost two decades.\nNo one should expect members of these groups to go through\nthe rest of their lives thinking the same thing about in\ufb02ation.\nOr the stock market. Or unemployment. Or money in general.\nNo one should expect them to respond to \ufb01nancial information\nthe same way. No one should assume they are in\ufb02uenced by\nthe same incentives.\nNo one should expect them to trust the same sources of advice.\nNo one should expect them to agree on what matters, what\u2019s\nworth it, what\u2019s likely to happen next, and what the best path\nforward is.\nTheir view of money was formed in di\ufb00erent worlds. And when\nthat\u2019s the case, a view about money that one group of people\nthinks is outrageous can make perfect sense to another.\nA few years ago, The New York Times did a story on the working\nconditions of Foxconn, the massive Taiwanese electronics\nmanufacturer. The conditions are often atrocious. Readers were\nrightly upset. But a fascinating response to the story came\nfrom the nephew of a Chinese worker, who wrote in the\ncomment section:\n\u00a0\nMy aunt worked several years in what Americans call \u201csweat\nshops.\u201d It was hard work. Long hours, \u201csmall\u201d wage, \u201cpoor\u201d\nworking conditions. Do you know what my aunt did before she\nworked in one of these factories? She was a prostitute.\nThe idea of working in a \u201csweat shop\u201d compared to that old\nlifestyle is an improvement, in my opinion. I know that my aunt\nwould rather be \u201cexploited\u201d by an evil capitalist boss for a\ncouple of dollars than have her body be exploited by several\nmen for pennies.\nThat is why I am upset by many Americans\u2019 thinking. We do\nnot have the same opportunities as the West. Our\ngovernmental infrastructure is di\ufb00erent. The country is\ndi\ufb00erent. Yes, factory is hard labor. Could it be better? Yes, but\nonly when you compare such to American jobs.\n\u00a0\nI don\u2019t know what to make of this. Part of me wants to argue,\n\ufb01ercely. Part of me wants to understand. But mostly it\u2019s an\nexample of how di\ufb00erent experiences can lead to vastly\ndi\ufb00erent views within topics that one side intuitively thinks\nshould be black and white.\nEvery decision people make with money is justi\ufb01ed by taking\nthe information they have at the moment and plugging it into\ntheir unique mental model of how the world works.\nThose people can be misinformed. They can have incomplete\ninformation. They can be bad at math. They can be persuaded\nby rotten marketing. They can have no idea what they\u2019re doing.\nThey can misjudge the consequences of their actions. Oh, can\nthey ever.\nBut every \ufb01nancial decision a person makes, makes sense to\nthem in that moment and checks the boxes they need to\ncheck. They tell themselves a story about what they\u2019re doing\nand why they\u2019re doing it, and that story has been shaped by\ntheir own unique experiences.\nTake a simple example: lottery tickets.\nAmericans spend more on them than movies, video games,\nmusic, sporting events, and books combined.\nAnd who buys them? Mostly poor people.\nThe lowest-income households in the U.S. on average spend\n$412 a year on lotto tickets, four times the amount of those in\nthe highest income groups. Forty percent of Americans cannot\ncome up with $400 in an emergency. Which is to say: Those\nbuying $400 in lottery tickets are by and large the same people\nwho say they couldn\u2019t come up with $400 in an emergency.\nThey are blowing their safety nets on something with a one-in-\nmillions chance of hitting it big.\nThat seems crazy to me. It probably seems crazy to you, too.\nBut I\u2019m not in the lowest income group. You\u2019re likely not, either.\nSo it\u2019s hard for many of us to intuitively grasp the subconscious\nreasoning of low-income lottery ticket buyers.\nBut strain a little, and you can imagine it going something like\nthis:\n\u00a0\nWe live paycheck-to-paycheck and saving seems out of reach.\nOur prospects for much higher wages seem out of reach. We\ncan\u2019t a\ufb00ord nice vacations, new cars, health insurance, or\nhomes in safe neighborhoods. We can\u2019t put our kids through\ncollege without crippling debt. Much of the stu\ufb00 you people\nwho read \ufb01nance books either have now, or have a good\nchance of getting, we don\u2019t. Buying a lottery ticket is the only\ntime in our lives we can hold a tangible dream of getting the\ngood stu\ufb00 that you already have and take for granted. We are\npaying for a dream, and you may not understand that because\nyou are already living a dream. That\u2019s why we buy more tickets\nthan you do.\n\u00a0\nYou don\u2019t have to agree with this reasoning. Buying lotto\ntickets when you\u2019re broke is still a bad idea. But I can kind of\nunderstand why lotto ticket sales persist.\nAnd that idea\u2014\u201cWhat you\u2019re doing seems crazy but I kind of\nunderstand why you\u2019re doing it.\u201d\u2014uncovers the root of many of\nour \ufb01nancial decisions.\nFew people make \ufb01nancial decisions purely with a\nspreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a\ncompany meeting. Places where personal history, your own\nunique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd\nincentives are scrambled together into a narrative that works\nfor you.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnother important point that helps explain why money\ndecisions are so di\ufb03cult, and why there is so much\nmisbehavior, is to recognize how new this topic is.\nMoney has been around a long time. King Alyattes of Lydia,\nnow part of Turkey, is thought to have created the \ufb01rst o\ufb03cial\ncurrency in 600 BC. But the modern foundation of money\ndecisions\u2014saving and investing\u2014is based around concepts\nthat are practically infants.\nTake retirement. At the end of 2018 there was $27 trillion in\nU.S. retirement accounts, making it the main driver of the\ncommon investor\u2019s saving and investing decisions.\u2075\nBut the entire concept of being entitled to retirement is, at\nmost, two generations old.\nBefore World War II most Americans worked until they died.\nThat was the expectation and the reality. The labor force\nparticipation rate of men age 65 and over was above 50% until\nthe 1940s:\n\u00a0\n"

                "content": "\u00a0\nSocial Security aimed to change this. But its initial bene\ufb01ts\nwere nothing close to a proper pension. When Ida May Fuller\ncashed the \ufb01rst Social Security check in 1940, it was for\n$22.54, or $416 adjusted for in\ufb02ation. It was not until the\n1980s that the average Social Security check for retirees\nexceeded $1,000 a month adjusted for in\ufb02ation. More than a\nquarter of Americans over age 65 were classi\ufb01ed by the Census\nBureau as living in poverty until the late 1960s.\nThere is a widespread belief along the lines of, \u201ceveryone used\nto have a private pension.\u201d But this is wildly exaggerated. The\nEmployee Bene\ufb01t Research Institute explains: \u201cOnly a quarter\nof those age 65 or older had pension income in 1975.\u201d Among\nthat lucky minority, only 15% of household income came from\na pension.\nThe New York Times wrote in 1955 about the growing desire,\nbut continued inability, to retire: \u201cTo rephrase an old saying:\neveryone talks about retirement, but apparently very few do\nanything about it.\u201d\u2076\nIt was not until the 1980s that the idea that everyone deserves,\nand should have, a digni\ufb01ed retirement took hold. And the way\nto get that digni\ufb01ed retirement ever since has been an\nexpectation that everyone will save and invest their own\nmoney.\nLet me reiterate how new this idea is: The 401(k)\u2014the\nbackbone savings vehicle of American retirement\u2014did not\nexist until 1978. The Roth IRA was not born until 1998. If it\nwere a person it would be barely old enough to drink.\nIt should surprise no one that many of us are bad at saving and\ninvesting for retirement. We\u2019re not crazy. We\u2019re all just\nnewbies.\nSame goes for college. The share of Americans over age 25\nwith a bachelor\u2019s degree has gone from less than 1 in 20 in\n1940 to 1 in 4 by 2015.\u2077 The average college tuition over that\ntime rose more than fourfold adjusted for in\ufb02ation.\u2078 Something\nso big and so important hitting society so fast explains why, for\nexample, so many people have made poor decisions with\nstudent loans over the last 20 years. There is not decades of\naccumulated experience to even attempt to learn from. We\u2019re\nwinging it.\nSame for index funds, which are less than 50 years old. And\nhedge funds, which didn\u2019t take o\ufb00 until the last 25 years. Even\nwidespread use of consumer debt\u2014mortgages, credit cards,\nand car loans\u2014did not take o\ufb00 until after World War II, when\nthe GI Bill made it easier for millions of Americans to borrow.\nDogs were domesticated 10,000 years ago and still retain\nsome behaviors of their wild ancestors. Yet here we are, with\nbetween 20 and 50 years of experience in the modern \ufb01nancial\nsystem, hoping to be perfectly acclimated.\nFor a topic that is so in\ufb02uenced by emotion versus fact, this is a\nproblem. And it helps explain why we don\u2019t always do what\nwe\u2019re supposed to with money.\nWe all do crazy stu\ufb00 with money, because we\u2019re all relatively\nnew to this game and what looks crazy to you might make\nsense to me. But no one is crazy\u2014we all make decisions based\non our own unique experiences that seem to make sense to us\nin a given moment.\nNow let me tell you a story about how Bill Gates got rich.\n"

                "content": "Luck and risk are siblings. They are both the reality that\nevery outcome in life is guided by forces other than\nindividual e\ufb00ort.\nNYU professor Scott Galloway has a related idea that is so\nimportant to remember when judging success\u2014both your\nown and others\u2019: \u201cNothing is as good or as bad as it seems.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBill Gates went to one of the only high schools in the world\nthat had a computer.\nThe story of how Lakeside School, just outside Seattle, even\ngot a computer is remarkable.\nBill Dougall was a World War II navy pilot turned high school\nmath and science teacher. \u201cHe believed that book study\nwasn\u2019t enough without real-world experience. He also\nrealized that we\u2019d need to know something about\ncomputers when we got to college,\u201d recalled late Microsoft\nco-founder Paul Allen.\nIn 1968 Dougall petitioned the Lakeside School Mothers\u2019\nClub to use the proceeds from its annual rummage sale\u2014\nabout $3,000\u2014to lease a Teletype Model 30 computer\nhooked up to the General Electric mainframe terminal for\ncomputer time-sharing. \u201cThe whole idea of time-sharing\nonly got invented in 1965,\u201d Gates later said. \u201cSomeone was\npretty forwardlooking.\u201d Most university graduate schools did\nnot have a computer anywhere near as advanced as Bill\nGates had access to in eighth grade. And he couldn\u2019t get\nenough of it.\nGates was 13 years old in 1968 when he met classmate Paul\nAllen. Allen was also obsessed with the school\u2019s computer,\nand the two hit it o\ufb00.\nLakeside\u2019s computer wasn\u2019t part of its general curriculum. It\nwas an independent study program. Bill and Paul could toy\naway with the thing at their leisure, letting their creativity\nrun wild\u2014after school, late into the night, on weekends.\nThey quickly became computing experts.\nDuring one of their late-night sessions, Allen recalled Gates\nshowing him a Fortune magazine and saying, \u201cWhat do you\nthink it\u2019s like to run a Fortune 500 company?\u201d Allen said he\nhad no idea. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll have our own computer company\nsomeday,\u201d Gates said. Microsoft is now worth more than a\ntrillion dollars.\nA little quick math.\nIn 1968 there were roughly 303 million high-school-age\npeople in the world, according to the UN.\nAbout 18 million of them lived in the United States.\nAbout 270,000 of them lived in Washington state.\nA little over 100,000 of them lived in the Seattle area.\nAnd only about 300 of them attended Lakeside School.\nStart with 303 million, end with 300.\nOne in a million high-school-age students attended the high\nschool that had the combination of cash and foresight to\nbuy a computer. Bill Gates happened to be one of them.\nGates is not shy about what this meant. \u201cIf there had been\nno Lakeside, there would have been no Microsoft,\u201d he told\nthe school\u2019s graduating class in 2005.\nGates is staggeringly smart, even more hardworking, and as\na teenager had a vision for computers that even most\nseasoned computer executives couldn\u2019t grasp. He also had a\none in a million head start by going to school at Lakeside.\nNow let me tell you about Gates\u2019 friend Kent Evans. He\nexperienced an equally powerful dose of luck\u2019s close sibling,\nrisk.\nBill Gates and Paul Allen became household names thanks\nto Microsoft\u2019s success. But back at Lakeside there was a\nthird member of this gang of high-school computer\nprodigies.\nKent Evans and Bill Gates became best friends in eighth\ngrade. Evans was, by Gates\u2019 own account, the best student\nin the class.\nThe two talked \u201con the phone ridiculous amounts,\u201d Gates\nrecalls in the documentary Inside Bill\u2019s Brain. \u201cI still know\nKent\u2019s phone number,\u201d he says. \u201c525-7851.\u201d\nEvans was as skilled with computers as Gates and Allen.\nLakeside once struggled to manually put together the\nschool\u2019s class schedule\u2014a maze of complexity to get\nhundreds of students the classes they need at times that\ndon\u2019t con\ufb02ict with other courses. The school tasked Bill and\nKent\u2014children, by any measure\u2014to build a computer\nprogram to solve the problem. It worked.\nAnd unlike Paul Allen, Kent shared Bill\u2019s business mind and\nendless ambition. \u201cKent always had the big briefcase, like a\nlawyer\u2019s briefcase,\u201d Gates recalls. \u201cWe were always\nscheming about what we\u2019d be doing \ufb01ve or six years in the\nfuture. Should we go be CEOs? What kind of impact could\nyou have? Should we go be generals? Should we go be\nambassadors?\u201d Whatever it was, Bill and Kent knew they\u2019d\ndo it together.\nAfter reminiscing on his friendship with Kent, Gates trails o\ufb00.\n\u201cWe would have kept working together. I\u2019m sure we would\nhave gone to college together.\u201d Kent could have been a\nfounding partner of Microsoft with Gates and Allen.\nBut it would never happen. Kent died in a mountaineering\naccident before he graduated high school.\nEvery year there are around three dozen mountaineering\ndeaths in the United States.\u2079 The odds of being killed on a\nmountain in high school are roughly one in a million.\nBill Gates experienced one in a million luck by ending up at\nLakeside. Kent Evans experienced one in a million risk by\nnever getting to \ufb01nish what he and Gates set out to achieve.\nThe same force, the same magnitude, working in opposite\ndirections.\nLuck and risk are both the reality that every outcome in life\nis guided by forces other than individual e\ufb00ort. They are so\nsimilar that you can\u2019t believe in one without equally\nrespecting the other. They both happen because the world is\ntoo complex to allow 100% of your actions to dictate 100%\nof your outcomes. They are driven by the same thing: You\nare one person in a game with seven billion other people\nand in\ufb01nite moving parts. The accidental impact of actions\noutside of your control can be more consequential than the\nones you consciously take.\nBut both are so hard to measure, and hard to accept, that\nthey too often go overlooked. For every Bill Gates there is a\nKent Evans who was just as skilled and driven but ended up\non the other side of life roulette.\nIf you give luck and risk their proper respect, you realize that\nwhen judging people\u2019s \ufb01nancial success\u2014both your own\nand others\u2019\u2014it\u2019s never as good or as bad as it seems.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYears ago I asked economist Robert Shiller, who won the\nNobel Prize in economics, \u201cWhat do you want to know about\ninvesting that we can\u2019t know?\u201d\n\u201cThe exact role of luck in successful outcomes,\u201d he\nanswered.\nI love that response, because no one actually thinks luck\ndoesn\u2019t play a role in \ufb01nancial success. But since it\u2019s hard to\nquantify luck and rude to suggest people\u2019s success is owed\nto it, the default stance is often to implicitly ignore luck as a\nfactor of success.\nIf I say, \u201cThere are a billion investors in the world. By sheer\nchance, would you expect 10 of them to become billionaires\npredominantly o\ufb00 luck?\u201d You would reply, \u201cOf course.\u201d But\nthen if I ask you to name those investors\u2014to their face\u2014you\nwill likely back down.\nWhen judging others, attributing success to luck makes you\nlook jealous and mean, even if we know it exists. And when\njudging yourself, attributing success to luck can be too\ndemoralizing to accept.\n"

                "content": "After spending years around investors and business leaders\nI\u2019ve come to realize that someone else\u2019s failure is usually\nattributed to bad decisions, while your own failures are\nusually chalked up to the dark side of risk. When judging\nyour failures I\u2019m likely to prefer a clean and simple story of\ncause and e\ufb00ect, because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on\ninside your head. \u201cYou had a bad outcome so it must have\nbeen caused by a bad decision\u201d is the story that makes the\nmost sense to me. But when judging myself I can make up a\nwild narrative justifying my past decisions and attributing\nbad outcomes to risk.\nThe cover of Forbes magazine does not celebrate poor\ninvestors who made good decisions but happened to\nexperience the unfortunate side of risk. But it almost\ncertainly celebrates rich investors who made OK or even\nreckless decisions and happened to get lucky. Both \ufb02ipped\nthe same coin that happened to land on a di\ufb00erent side.\nThe dangerous part of this is that we\u2019re all trying to learn\nabout what works and what doesn\u2019t with money.\nWhat investing strategies work? Which ones don\u2019t?\nWhat business strategies work? Which ones don\u2019t?\nHow do you get rich? How do you avoid being poor?\nWe tend to seek out these lessons by observing successes\nand failures and saying, \u201cDo what she did, avoid what he\ndid.\u201d\nIf we had a magic wand we would \ufb01nd out exactly what\nproportion of these outcomes were caused by actions that\nare repeatable, versus the role of random risk and luck that\nswayed those actions one way or the other. But we don\u2019t\nhave a magic wand. We have brains that prefer easy\nanswers without much appetite for nuance. So identifying\nthe traits we should emulate or avoid can be agonizingly\nhard.\nLet me tell you another story of someone who, like Bill\nGates, was wildly successful, but whose success is hard to\npin down as being caused by luck or skill.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCornelius Vanderbilt had just \ufb01nished a series of business\ndeals to expand his railroad empire.\nOne of his business advisors leaned in to tell Vanderbilt that\nevery transaction he agreed to broke the law.\n\u201cMy God, John,\u201d said Vanderbilt, \u201cYou don\u2019t suppose you can\nrun a railroad in accordance with the statutes of the State of\nNew York, do you?\u201d\u00b9\u2070\nMy \ufb01rst thought when reading this was: \u201cThat attitude is\nwhy he was so successful.\u201d Laws didn\u2019t accommodate\nrailroads during Vanderbilt\u2019s day. So he said \u201cto hell with it\u201d\nand went ahead anyway.\nVanderbilt was wildly successful. So it\u2019s tempting to view his\nlaw-\ufb02aunting\u2014which was notorious and vital to his success\n\u2014as sage wisdom. That scrappy visionary let nothing get in\nhis way!\nBut how dangerous is that analysis? No sane person would\nrecommend \ufb02agrant crime as an entrepreneurial trait. You\ncan easily imagine Vanderbilt\u2019s story turning out much\ndi\ufb00erent\u2014an outlaw whose young company collapsed under\ncourt order.\nSo we have a problem here.\nYou can praise Vanderbilt for \ufb02aunting the law with as much\npassion as you criticize Enron for doing the same. Perhaps\none got lucky by avoiding the arm of the law while the other\nfound itself on the side of risk.\nJohn D. Rockefeller is similar. His frequent circumventing of\nthe law\u2014a judge once called his company \u201cno better than a\ncommon thief\u201d\u2014is often portrayed by historians as cunning\nbusiness smarts. Maybe it was. But when does the narrative\nshift from, \u201cYou didn\u2019t let outdated laws get in the way of\ninnovation,\u201d to \u201cYou committed a crime?\u201d Or how little\nwould the story have to shift for the narrative to have turned\nfrom \u201cRockefeller was a genius, try to learn from his\nsuccesses,\u201d to \u201cRockefeller was a criminal, try to learn from\nhis business failures.\u201d Very little.\n\u201cWhat do I care about the law?\u201d Vanderbilt once said. \u201cAin\u2019t I\ngot the power?\u201d\nHe did, and it worked. But it\u2019s easy to imagine those being\nthe last words of a story with a very di\ufb00erent outcome. The\nline between bold and reckless can be thin. When we don\u2019t\ngive risk and luck their proper billing it\u2019s often invisible.\nBenjamin Graham is known as one of the greatest investors\nof all time, the father of value investing and the early\nmentor of Warren Bu\ufb00ett. But the majority of Benjamin\nGraham\u2019s investing success was due to owning an enormous\nchunk of GEICO stock which, by his own admission, broke\nnearly every diversi\ufb01cation rule that Graham himself laid out\nin his famous texts. Where does the thin line between bold\nand reckless fall here? I don\u2019t know. Graham wrote about his\nGEICO bonanza: \u201cOne lucky break, or one supremely shrewd\ndecision\u2014can we tell them apart?\u201d Not easily.\nWe similarly think Mark Zuckerberg is a genius for turning\ndown Yahoo!\u2019s 2006 $1 billion o\ufb00er to buy his company. He\nsaw the future and stuck to his guns. But people criticize\nYahoo! with as much passion for turning down its own big\nbuyout o\ufb00er from Microsoft\u2014those fools should have cashed\nout while they could! What is the lesson for entrepreneurs\nhere? I have no idea, because risk and luck are so hard to\npin down.\nThere are so many examples of this.\nCountless fortunes (and failures) owe their outcome to\nleverage.\nThe best (and worst) managers drive their employees as\nhard as they can.\n\u201cThe customer is always right\u201d and \u201ccustomers don\u2019t know\nwhat they want\u201d are both accepted business wisdom.\nThe line between \u201cinspiringly bold\u201d and \u201cfoolishly reckless\u201d\ncan be a millimeter thick and only visible with hindsight.\nRisk and luck are doppelgangers.\nThis is not an easy problem to solve. The di\ufb03culty in\nidentifying what is luck, what is skill, and what is risk is one\nof the biggest problems we face when trying to learn about\nthe best way to manage money.\nBut two things can point you in a better direction.\n\u00a0\nBe careful who you praise and admire. Be careful\nwho you look down upon and wish to avoid\nbecoming.\n\u00a0\nOr, just be careful when assuming that 100% of outcomes\ncan be attributed to e\ufb00ort and decisions. After my son was\nborn, I wrote him a letter that said, in part:\n\u00a0\nSome people are born into families that encourage\neducation; others are against it. Some are born into\n\ufb02ourishing economies encouraging of entrepreneurship;\nothers are born into war and destitution. I want you to be\nsuccessful, and I want you to earn it. But realize that not all\nsuccess is due to hard work, and not all poverty is due to\nlaziness. Keep this in mind when judging people, including\nyourself.\n\u00a0\nTherefore, focus less on speci\ufb01c individuals and case\nstudies and more on broad patterns.\n\u00a0\nStudying a speci\ufb01c person can be dangerous because we\ntend to study extreme examples\u2014the billionaires, the CEOs,\nor the massive failures that dominate the news\u2014and\nextreme examples are often the least applicable to other\nsituations, given their complexity. The more extreme the\noutcome, the less likely you can apply its lessons to your\nown life, because the more likely the outcome was\nin\ufb02uenced by extreme ends of luck or risk.\nYou\u2019ll get closer to actionable takeaways by looking for\nbroad patterns of success and failure. The more common the\npattern, the more applicable it might be to your life. Trying\nto emulate Warren Bu\ufb00ett\u2019s investment success is hard,\nbecause his results are so extreme that the role of luck in his\nlifetime performance is very likely high, and luck isn\u2019t\nsomething you can reliably emulate. But realizing, as we\u2019ll\nsee in chapter 7, that people who have control over their\ntime tend to be happier in life is a broad and common\nenough observation that you can do something with it.\nMy favorite historian, Frederick Lewis Allen, spent his career\ndepicting the life of the average, median American\u2014how\nthey lived, how they changed, what they did for work, what\nthey ate for dinner, etc. There are more relevant lessons to\ntake away from this kind of broad observation than there are\nin studying the extreme characters that tend to dominate\nthe news.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBill Gates once said, \u201cSuccess is a lousy teacher. It seduces\nsmart people into thinking they can\u2019t lose.\u201d\nWhen things are going extremely well, realize it\u2019s not as\ngood as you think. You are not invincible, and if you\nacknowledge that luck brought you success then you have\nto believe in luck\u2019s cousin, risk, which can turn your story\naround just as quickly.\nBut the same is true in the other direction.\nFailure can be a lousy teacher, because it seduces smart\npeople into thinking their decisions were terrible when\nsometimes they just re\ufb02ect the unforgiving realities of risk.\nThe trick when dealing with failure is arranging your\n\ufb01nancial life in a way that a bad investment here and a\nmissed \ufb01nancial goal there won\u2019t wipe you out so you can\nkeep playing until the odds fall in your favor.\nBut more important is that as much as we recognize the role\nof luck in success, the role of risk means we should forgive\nourselves and leave room for understanding when judging\nfailures.\nNothing is as good or as bad as it seems.\nNow let\u2019s look at the stories of two men who pushed their\nluck.\n"

                "content": "John Bogle, the Vanguard founder who passed away in 2019,\nonce told a story about money that highlights something we\ndon\u2019t think about enough:\n\u00a0\nAt a party given by a billionaire on Shelter Island, Kurt\nVonnegut informs his pal, Joseph Heller, that their host, a\nhedge fund manager, had made more money in a single day\nthan Heller had earned from his wildly popular novel Catch-\n22 over its whole history. Heller responds, \u201cYes, but I have\nsomething he will never have \u2026 enough.\u201d\nEnough. I was stunned by the simple eloquence of that word\n\u2014stunned for two reasons: \ufb01rst, because I have been given\nso much in my own life and, second, because Joseph Heller\ncouldn\u2019t have been more accurate.\nFor a critical element of our society, including many of the\nwealthiest and most powerful among us, there seems to be\nno limit today on what enough entails.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s so smart, and so powerful.\nLet me o\ufb00er two examples of the dangers of not having\nenough, and what they can teach us.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRajat Gupta was born in Kolkata and orphaned as a\nteenager. People talk about the privileged few who begin life\non third base. Gupta couldn\u2019t even see the baseball\nstadium.\nWhat he went on to achieve from those beginnings was\nsimply phenomenal.\nBy his mid 40s Gupta was CEO of McKinsey, the world\u2019s\nmost prestigious consulting \ufb01rm. He retired in 2007 to take\non roles with the United Nations and the World Economic\nForum. He partnered on philanthropic work with Bill Gates.\nHe sat on the board of directors of \ufb01ve public companies.\nFrom the slums of Kolkata, Gupta had quite literally become\none of the most successful businessmen alive.\nWith his success came enormous wealth. By 2008 Gupta\nwas reportedly worth $100 million.\u00b9\u00b9 It\u2019s an unfathomable\nsum of money to most. A \ufb01ve percent annual return on that\nmuch money generates almost $600 an hour, 24 hours a\nday.\nHe could have done anything he wanted in life.\nAnd what he wanted, by all accounts, wasn\u2019t to be a mere\ncenta-millionaire. Rajat Gupta wanted to be a billionaire.\nAnd he wanted it badly.\nGupta sat on the board of directors of Goldman Sachs,\nwhich surrounded him with some of the wealthiest investors\nin the world. One investor, citing the paydays of private\nequity tycoons, described Gupta like this: \u201cI think he wants\nto be in that circle. That\u2019s a billionaire circle, right? Goldman\nis like the hundreds of millions circle, right?\u201d\u00b9\u00b2\nRight. So Gupta found a lucrative side hustle.\nIn 2008, as Goldman Sachs stared at the wrath of the\n\ufb01nancial crisis, Warren Bu\ufb00ett planned to invest $5 billion\ninto the bank to help it survive. As a Goldman board\nmember Gupta learned of this transaction before the public.\nIt was valuable information. Goldman\u2019s survival was in\ndoubt and Bu\ufb00ett\u2019s backing would surely send its stock\nsoaring.\nSixteen seconds after learning of the pending deal Gupta,\nwho was dialed into the Goldman board meeting, hung up\nthe phone and called a hedge fund manager named Raj\nRajaratnam. The call wasn\u2019t recorded, but Rajaratnam\nimmediately bought 175,000 shares of Goldman Sachs, so\nyou can guess what was discussed. The Bu\ufb00ett-Goldman\ndeal was announced to the public hours later. Goldman\nstock surged. Rajaratnam made a quick $1 million.\nThat was just one example of an alleged trend. The SEC\nclaims Gupta\u2019s insider tips led to $17 million in pro\ufb01ts.\nIt was easy money. And, for prosecutors, it was an even\neasier case.\nGupta and Rajaratnam both went to prison for insider\ntrading, their careers and reputations irrevocably ruined.\nNow consider Bernie Mado\ufb00. His crime is well known. Mado\ufb00\nis the most notorious Ponzi schemer since Charles Ponzi\nhimself. Mado\ufb00 swindled investors for two decades before\nhis crime was revealed\u2014ironically just weeks after Gupta\u2019s\nendeavor.\nWhat\u2019s overlooked is that Mado\ufb00, like Gupta, was more than\na fraudster. Before the Ponzi scheme that made Mado\ufb00\nfamous he was a wildly successful and legitimate\nbusinessman.\nMado\ufb00 was a market maker, a job that matches buyers and\nsellers of stocks. He was very good at it. Here\u2019s how The Wall\nStreet Journal described Mado\ufb00\u2019s market-making \ufb01rm in\n1992:\n\u00a0\nHe has built a highly pro\ufb01table securities \ufb01rm, Bernard L.\nMado\ufb00 Investment Securities, which siphons a huge volume\nof stock trades away from the Big Board. The $740 million\naverage daily volume of trades executed electronically by\nthe Mado\ufb00 \ufb01rm o\ufb00 the exchange equals 9% of the New York\nexchange\u2019s. Mr. Mado\ufb00\u2019s \ufb01rm can execute trades so quickly\nand cheaply that it actually pays other brokerage \ufb01rms a\npenny a share to execute their customers\u2019 orders, pro\ufb01ting\nfrom the spread between bid and ask prices that most\nstocks trade for.\n\u00a0\nThis is not a journalist inaccurately describing a fraud yet to\nbe uncovered; Mado\ufb00\u2019s market-making business was\nlegitimate. A former sta\ufb00er said the market-making arm of\nMado\ufb00\u2019s business made between $25 million and $50\nmillion per year.\nBernie Mado\ufb00\u2019s legitimate, non-fraudulent business was by\nany measure a huge success. It made him hugely\u2014and\nlegitimately\u2014wealthy.\nAnd yet, the fraud.\nThe question we should ask of both Gupta and Mado\ufb00 is why\nsomeone worth hundreds of millions of dollars would be so\ndesperate for more money that they risked everything in\npursuit of even more.\nCrime committed by those living on the edge of survival is\none thing. A Nigerian scam artist once told The New York\nTimes that he felt guilty for hurting others, but \u201cpoverty will\nnot make you feel the pain.\u201d\u00b9\u00b3\nWhat Gupta and Mado\ufb00 did is something di\ufb00erent. They\nalready had everything: unimaginable wealth, prestige,\npower, freedom. And they threw it all away because they\nwanted more.\nThey had no sense of enough.\nThey are extreme examples. But there are non-criminal\nversions of this behavior.\nThe hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management was sta\ufb00ed\nwith traders personally worth tens and hundreds of millions\nof dollars each, with most of their wealth invested in their\nown funds. Then they took so much risk in the quest for\nmore that they managed to lose everything\u2014in 1998, in the\nmiddle of the greatest bull market and strongest economy in\nhistory. Warren Bu\ufb00ett later put it:\n\u00a0\nTo make money they didn\u2019t have and didn\u2019t need, they\nrisked what they did have and did need. And that\u2019s foolish. It\nis just plain foolish. If you risk something that is important to\nyou for something that is unimportant to you, it just does\nnot make any sense.\n\u00a0\nThere is no reason to risk what you have and need for what\nyou don\u2019t have and don\u2019t need.\nIt\u2019s one of those things that\u2019s as obvious as it is overlooked.\nFew of us will ever have $100 million, as Gupta or Mado\ufb00\ndid. But a measurable percentage of those reading this book\nwill, at some point in their life, earn a salary or have a sum\nof money su\ufb03cient to cover every reasonable thing they\nneed and a lot of what they want.\nIf you\u2019re one of them, remember a few things.\n\u00a0\n1. The hardest \ufb01nancial skill is getting the goalpost\nto stop moving.\n\u00a0\nBut it\u2019s one of the most important. If expectations rise with\nresults there is no logic in striving for more because you\u2019ll\nfeel the same after putting in extra e\ufb00ort. It gets dangerous\nwhen the taste of having more\u2014more money, more power,\nmore prestige\u2014increases ambition faster than satisfaction.\nIn that case one step forward pushes the goalpost two steps\nahead. You feel as if you\u2019re falling behind, and the only way\nto catch up is to take greater and greater amounts of risk.\nModern capitalism is a pro at two things: generating wealth\nand generating envy. Perhaps they go hand in hand; wanting\nto surpass your peers can be the fuel of hard work. But life\nisn\u2019t any fun without a sense of enough. Happiness, as it\u2019s\nsaid, is just results minus expectations.\n\u00a0\n2. Social comparison is the problem here.\n\u00a0\nConsider a rookie baseball player who earns $500,000 a\nyear. He is, by any de\ufb01nition, rich. But say he plays on the\nsame team as Mike Trout, who has a 12-year, $430 million\ncontract. By comparison, the rookie is broke. But then think\nabout Mike Trout. Thirty-six million dollars per year is an\ninsane amount of money. But to make it on the list of the\ntop-ten highest-paid hedge fund managers in 2018 you\nneeded to earn at least $340 million in one year.\u00b9\u2074 That\u2019s\nwho people like Trout might compare their incomes to. And\nthe hedge fund manager who makes $340 million per year\ncompares himself to the top \ufb01ve hedge fund managers, who\nearned at least $770 million in 2018. Those top managers\ncan look ahead to people like Warren Bu\ufb00ett, whose\npersonal fortune increased by $3.5 billion in 2018. And\nsomeone like Bu\ufb00ett could look ahead to Je\ufb00 Bezos, whose\nnet worth increased by $24 billion in 2018\u2014a sum that\nequates to more per hour than the \u201crich\u201d baseball player\nmade in a full year.\nThe point is that the ceiling of social comparison is so high\nthat virtually no one will ever hit it. Which means it\u2019s a\nbattle that can never be won, or that the only way to win is\nto not \ufb01ght to begin with\u2014to accept that you might have\nenough, even if it\u2019s less than those around you.\nA friend of mine makes an annual pilgrimage to Las Vegas.\nOne year he asked a dealer: What games do you play, and\nwhat casinos do you play in? The dealer, stone-cold serious,\nreplied: \u201cThe only way to win in a Las Vegas casino is to exit\nas soon as you enter.\u201d\nThat\u2019s exactly how the game of trying to keep up with other\npeople\u2019s wealth works, too.\n\u00a0\n3. \u201cEnough\u201d is not too little.\n\u00a0\nThe idea of having \u201cenough\u201d might look like conservatism,\nleaving opportunity and potential on the table.\nI don\u2019t think that\u2019s right.\n\u201cEnough\u201d is realizing that the opposite\u2014an insatiable\nappetite for more\u2014will push you to the point of regret.\nThe only way to know how much food you can eat is to eat\nuntil you\u2019re sick. Few try this because vomiting hurts more\nthan any meal is good. For some reason the same logic\ndoesn\u2019t translate to business and investing, and many will\nonly stop reaching for more when they break and are forced\nto. This can be as innocent as burning out at work or a risky\ninvestment allocation you can\u2019t maintain. On the other end\nthere\u2019s Rajat Guptas and Bernie Mado\ufb00s in the world, who\nresort to stealing because every dollar is worth reaching for\nregardless of consequence.\nWhatever it is, the inability to deny a potential dollar will\neventually catch up to you.\n\u00a0\n4. There are many things never worth risking, no\nmatter the potential gain.\n\u00a0\nAfter he was released from prison Rajat Gupta told The New\nYork Times he had learned a lesson:\n\u00a0\nDon\u2019t get too attached to anything\u2014your reputation, your\naccomplishments or any of it. I think about it now, what\ndoes it matter? O.K., this thing unjustly destroyed my\nreputation. That\u2019s only troubling if I am so attached to my\nreputation.\n\u00a0\n"
